        <h1> Extension Project: Empowering Community ALS Implementers through Digital Citizenship </h1>
        <p>Digital Citizenship is responsible use of technology and etiquette pertaining to an online presence. This includes behaviors and responses to other within in digital community.

            The extension project brought a lot of learning and experiences that widened my knowledge on how to effectively and efficiently use the computer. A new lesson a learned like troubleshooting, hardware and software, slide master by the use of PowerPoint presentation and creating Webpage. It was difficult at first but it also seen to me many as an important concept to teach young students in the future teaching. I have discovered the have an effect on that our digital interaction can have on ourselves, others and society as a whole. 
            In addition, without the assistance of our very helpful and hands-on instructors, this worthwhile experience would never have been as enjoyable with my co implementers.
            Therefore, this extension project helped me to gain a lot of knowledge that I can apply to my future teaching. I am truly grateful for this opportunity.
